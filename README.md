# FYSM_Alexa_Skill

This is the logic for Mr. Wade Ashby's FYSM Alexa Skill project. 

Alexa, the Amazon voice assistant, is going to recieve a .csv file of historical information on most of the buildings located on the Hardin-Simmons campus.

After recieving said information, users will now be able to ask Alexa questions such as, "What year was the Johnson Building established?"
It is after this instance that Alexa will be able to go and traverse the file she was given and return the appropriate answer to the user.
